            <h3>This is a build log of my custom keyboard.</h3>
            <h4>It is inspired by the
                <a href="https://i.redd.it/hc4qt6avjmdz.jpg">minidox</a>
            </h4>
            <h5>STEP 1:DESIGN</h5>
            <p>I started off by designing the keyboard to fit my hand, with correct dimensions.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OmWktGa.jpg?1" title="source: imgur.com" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width:60%"
            />
            <p>Another terrific source of information on keyboard layout is
                <a href="https://matt3o.com/anatomy-of-a-keyboard/">matt3o's book</a>
            </p>
            <p>This is the first sort of mock-up of the keyboard layout. While I was designing the keyboard layout, I would
                constantly print out the current iteration of the keypad to scale on a peice of paper, and check how my hand
                would manage to reach the keys. Because I would do this, I never ran into a fitment problem for the actual
                keyboard.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>STEP 2:TOP PLATE</h5>
            <p>Now once the design was figured out and everything, the actual build could start. First the aluminum plates had
                to be made.</p>
            <li>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MRgdW6j.jpg" title="Precision filing in progress, test fitting switches" style="width:40%"
                />
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AvAYJSz.jpg" title="Plates finished after filing" style="width:40%" />
            </li>
            <p>That started with a sheet of aluminum, that I then used an angle grinder on to cut down to a similar shape and
                size to that of the keypad. After they were cut down to the correct size, then I drilled as many holes as
                possible where the keys should go. Once that had been done, pliers were then used to pull all the material
                that couldn't be gotten with the drill out. And finally, a file was used to get the corners square, and the
                size of the hole correct.
            </p>
            <h5>STEP 3:SOLDERING</h5>
            <p>Then began the soldering.</p>
            <li>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/px9JHNO.jpg" title="Precision filing in progress, test fitting switches" style="width:40%"
                />
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oMwRKNl.jpg" title="Plates finished after filing" style="width:40%" />
            </li>
            <p>For far more specific information on the soldering process, I highly recommend
                <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87689.0">Cribbit's keyboard soldering guide.</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>STEP 4:WOOD CENTER</h5>
            <p>Next came the wood. Sadly I seem to have lost all the photos that I took during the woodworking process, but
                in essence, it was very simple.</p>
            <p>I took a birch log, and cut two slightly slanted slabs out of it. this slant was then sanded down to the final
                size. Then a process very similar to the top plate was used, holes were drilled, and a chisel was used very
                carefully to remove the center from the outside. The holes for the ports were drilled in, and a file was
                used to shape the holes correctly. Then I sanded the top and bottom of the wood to give it it's correct slant
                and make sure that everything was flat. After a final sand on the inside to make sure that the keys fit,
                the top plate was screwed into place.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>STEP 5:BOTTOM PLATE</h5>
            <p>The process for the bottom plate was similar to the top plate, angle grinder to get roughly to the correct size.
                Drill a few holes and put the screws in, and boom. Time for the final sand.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GS6xdTk.jpg">
            <br>
            <h5>STEP 6:FINISHING TOUCHES</h5>
            <p>After liberous use of a hand sander and some sand paper, I sprayed the sides of the keyboard with laquer, let
                it dry overnight, and it was done!</p>
            <br>
            <h5>STEP 7:FIRMWARE</h5>
            <p>So now you have a keyboard, which is all wired up and connected, but the controller doesn't actually understand
                anything and doesn't know how to talk to the computer, so we have to teach it. I used an open source firmware
                called QMK. It is extremely powerful, and has more than enough features, with more constantly being added.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm not going to do a full write up on how to develop your own firmware for a keyboard, and how to flash
                it, but I will provide these two really useful links that I referenced a whole bunch.</p>
            <p>And the source code for my keyboard is on my github.</p>
