    <h1>Adoah is on Github!</h1>

    <p>Check out my "code respository" at <a href="https://github.com/adoah">https://github.com/adoah</a>. It is a place where I store code and where we can be social about code. I like C and java. How about you?</p>
   

<h3>COOL Fact!</h3>
<p>You can see the "source code" of my World Wide Website at the following hyper-link: <a href="https://github.com/adoah/adoah.github.io">https://github.com/adoah/adoah.github.io</a>

Please give me a "Star" because you never know if I'm having a bad day and I will need that star! Thx.
